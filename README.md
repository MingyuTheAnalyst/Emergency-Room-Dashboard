## Project Overview

This project aims to **analyze emergency room operations** using **Power BI** by developing a dynamic dashboard that provides insights into **patient flow, wait times, satisfaction scores, and department referrals**.  
The dashboard helps hospital administrators optimize emergency room efficiency and improve patient care.

---

## Data Sources

The dataset used includes:
- **Hospital Emergency Room records** (patient visits, wait times, admission status, referrals, and demographics).
- Data collected from hospital management systems.

---

## Tools

- **Power BI** – Data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **SQL** – Data transformation and querying.
- **Excel** – Data cleaning and preprocessing.

---

## Data Cleaning

To ensure high data quality, the following preprocessing steps were applied:

- **Handled missing values** in key fields like **Patient ID, Admission Status, and Wait Time**.
- **Standardized data formats**, ensuring uniformity in date/time and categorical variables.
- **Created calculated columns**, such as:
  - **Average Wait Time per Patient**
  - **Daily Patient Admission Trends**
  - **Referral Rate by Department**
- **Removed duplicates** from patient visit records.

---

## Dashboard Overview

The Power BI dashboard consists of **four key views**, each designed to provide different insights into hospital emergency room operations.

### Monthly View
**Objective**: Monitor key **ER metrics and trends on a monthly basis** to identify patterns and operational bottlenecks.

**Visuals Included:**
- **Patient Admission Status** (Admitted vs. Non-admitted)
- **Patient Age Distribution** (Grouped by 10-year intervals)
- **Department Referrals** (Top departments patients are referred to)
- **Timeliness Analysis** (Percentage of patients seen within 30 minutes)
- **Gender & Racial Demographics**
- **Hourly Patient Volume Trends**

### Consolidated View
**Objective**: Provide a **holistic summary** of hospital performance over a customizable date range.

 **Visuals Included:**
- Aggregated **patient volume trends**
- **Wait time distribution**
- **Admission vs. Discharge ratios**
- **Department workload comparison**
